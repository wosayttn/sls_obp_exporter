# NuMaker-IoT-M2354

The M2354 NuMaker-IoT board integrates the computing power of NuMicroÂ® M2354 IoT Series and complete microcontroller security functions, 
and equips Wi-Fi and LoRa communication modules on the board. The LoRa module also has two different frequency bands for communication between 
China and the United States. At the same time, the Arduino expansion interface designed on the development board can support any functional expansion
 board that connects the interface to the main board. For example, a sensor board with Arduino interface can use the onboard communication modules to transmits 
the data to the back-end server. In addition, since the M2354 IoT Security series itself has an LCD Controller and many security functions,
Nuvoton has also developed a function demonstration software and it comes with the development version.

## v2.0.1

This OBP includes multiple project files, such as NuEclipse, MDK Keil and IAR, to facilitate quick evaluation.
