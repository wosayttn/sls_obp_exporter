# NuMaker-HMI-M55M1

The NuMicro® M55M1/M5531 series microcontrollers stand out for their exceptional performance in digital signal processing
 and in-device machine learning inference. They are equipped with an Arm® Cortex®-M55 processor running up to 220 MHz. 
In addition to the Cortex-M55 core, they integrate an Arm® Ethos™-U55 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) as a coprocessor for 
accelerating neural network operations. The M55M1 series MCU has up to 1.5 MB of SRAM and 2 MB of flash memory for on-chip 
storage and adopts OctoSPI and HyperBus interfaces to support the expansion of RAM and flash memory capacity. 
It supports a low power supply voltage range from 1.6V to 3.6V and can operate within a temperature range of -40°C to +105°C.

The NuMaker-HMI-M55M1 integrates touchscreen display, voice input/output, rich serial port service and I/O interface, providing multiple external storage methods.

## v2.0.1
