# NuMaker-IIoT-NUC980G2D

The NuMaker-IIoT-NUC980G2(D) is an evaluation board based on Arm ARM926EJ-S microprocessor NUC980DK71YC
which has rich peripherals to help users to design-in their products or application systems easily.
In addition, the NuMaker-IIoT-NUC980G2 uses NUC980DK71YC microprocessor which runs up to 300 MHz with built-in 128 MB DDR2 memory,
16 KB I-cache, 16 KB D-cache and MMU, 16 KB embedded SRAM and 16.5 KB IBR (Internal Boot ROM) for system booting from USB,
SPI NAND Flash and SD/EMMC. All functions of the NUC980DK71YC are placed on the board, including peripheral interfaces such as memory
(SPI NAND Flash, eMMC, SD), UART, Audio controller (NAU88C22YG), 10/100 Mbps Ethernet MAC controller, high speed USB (device, HOST),
JTAG, CAN and EBI. Furthermore, the board provides Arduino Uno compatible interface for expansion. You can use it to develop and verify
applications to emulate the real behavior.

## v2.0.2

This OBP includes multiple project files, such as NuEclipse and MDK Keil, to facilitate quick evaluation.
