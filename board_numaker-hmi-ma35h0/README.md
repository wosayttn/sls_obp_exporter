# NuMaker-HMI-MA35H0

The NuMicro® MA35H0 series is a high-performance microprocessor specifically designed for industrial HMI applications. It is based on dual 64/32-bit Arm® Cortex®-A35 cores. 
The high-performance cores run up to 650 MHz and include 32/32 KB I/D L1 cache for each core, along with a 512 KB shared L2 cache.
The NuMaker-HMI-MA35H0-A1 is an evaluation board for Nuvoton NuMicro® MA35H0 series microprocessors, and consists of two parts: a NuMaker- HMI-MA35H04F70 board and a NuMaker-TFT-LCD7 board. 
The NuMaker-HMI-MA35H0-A1 board integrates core components to simplify the system design, based on MA35H04F764C 
(LQFP216 package, and stacking a 128 MB DDR), discrete power supply power solution, and one megabit Ethernet PHY. 
The NuMaker-HMI-MA35H0-A1 has rich peripherals such as 1 set of megabit Ethernet, USB2.0 high-speed host and device, 1 set of SD2.0 in Micro SD slot, 1 set of SD3.0 in SD slot, 1 set of CAN FD, 
SPI, I²C, UART, and 2 sets of RS-485/RS-232 serial communication ports for users to facilitate the evaluation in HMI and industrial control, 
home appliances, 2-wheel cluster, medical device, new energy applications, ML (Machine Learning) or your creative applications.

## v2.0.1
