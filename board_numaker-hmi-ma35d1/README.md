# NuMaker-HMI-MA35D1

The NuMaker-HMI-MA35D1 is an evaluation board for Nuvoton NuMicro MA35D1 series microprocessors, and consists of three parts: 
a NuMaker-SOM-MA35D16A81 SOM board, a NuMaker-BASE-MA35D1B1 base board and a 7 inch TFT-LCD daughter board. 
The SOM board integrates core components to simplify the system design, based on MA35D16A887C (BGA312 package, and 
stacking a 256 MB DDR), PMIC power solution, a 16 GB eMMC Flash, and two Gigabit Ethernet PHY. 
The NuMaker-HMI-MA35D1-S1 has rich peripherals such as 2 sets of Gigabit Ethernet, USB2.0 high-speed host and device, 
2 sets of CAN FD, and SPI, I2C, UART, RS-485 serial communication ports for users to facilitate the evaluation in HMI and industrial control, 
home appliances, 2-wheel cluster, medical device, new energy applications, ML (Machine Learning) or your creative applications.

## v2.0.1
